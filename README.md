GameRaven
=========

The original unofficial GameFAQs app for Android.

##What is GameRaven?  
GameRaven is an Android app that aims to enhance the GameFAQs experience on Android devices. The goal is to get the app to a level where it rivals the desktop browser + extension experience, and I feel that it has been moving steadily towards that goal. Give the app a try, you'll quickly see what the vanilla site has been missing.

##Requirements
* Android 4.0 or above
* GameFAQs Account (for accessing account-restricted boards and posting)

##Installation
You can install GameRaven from the Google Play Store.
